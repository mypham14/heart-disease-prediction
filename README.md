# Heart Disease Prediction
Combination of machine learning classification models to predict whether a person has a heart disease

Data source: framingham_heart_disease.csv - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression)

This project was created as the capstone assignment for Applied Machine Learning course at UT Dallas, including 2 projects:

Project 1 has 2 parts:
* **Part 1**: [Regression Task - Bike Rental Prediction](https://github.com/mypham14/bike-rental-prediction/blob/master/Project%201.ipynb): data cleaning, supervised machine learning regression models
* **Part 2**: [Classification Task - Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/mypham14/heart-disease-prediction/blob/master/Project%201.ipynb): data cleaning, supervised machine learning classification models
  - a mix of classification models *(ensemble learning, classification machine learning, principal component analysis and deep learning)* to provide hospitals a filtering system that helps patients identify and prevent potential predictors of having a heart disease 
  - Perform data cleansing and exploratory data analysis
     
Project 2 has 2 parts:
* **Part 1**: [Regression Task - Bike Rental Prediction](https://github.com/mypham14/bike-rental-prediction/blob/master/Project2_Regression.ipynb): ensemble learning, principal component analysis (PCA), regression models using PCA, deep learning (DL) models using neural networks
* **Part 2**: [Classification Task - Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/mypham14/heart-disease-prediction/blob/master/Project2_Classification.ipynb): ensemble learning, principal component analysis (PCA), classification models using PCA, deep learning (DL) models using neural networks
   - Apply a combination of models including Emsemble Learning (voting classifiers, bagging, pasting, adaboost and gradient boosting), Principal Component Analysis, Classification Machine Learning (KNN, Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine, Kernelilzed Support Vector Machine (rbf, poly, and linear), Decision Tree) and Deep Learning to predict whether a patient has a heart disease
   - Create Tableau dashboards for data analysis and visualization 
   - Automate the modeling process and deploy the chosen model into production in Azure ML
