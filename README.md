# Heart Disease Prediction
Combination of machine learning classification models to predict whether a person has a heart disease

Data source: framingham_heart_disease.csv - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression)

Project has 2 parts:
* **Part 1**: [Regression Task - Bike Rental Prediction]
* **Part 2**: Classification Task - Heart Disease Prediction
  - a mix of classification models *(ensemble learning, classification machine learning, principal component analysis and deep learning)* to provide hospitals a filtering system that helps patients identify and prevent potential predictors of having a heart disease 
     - Perform data cleansing and exploratory data analysis
     - Apply a combination of models including Emsemble Learning (voting classifiers, bagging, pasting, adaboost and gradient boosting), Principal Component Analysis, Classification Machine Learning (KNN, Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine, Kernelilzed Support Vector Machine (rbf, poly, and linear), Decision Tree) and Deep Learning to predict whether a patient has a heart disease
     - Create Tableau dashboards for data analysis and visualization 
     - Automate the modeling process and deploy the chosen model into production in Azure ML
